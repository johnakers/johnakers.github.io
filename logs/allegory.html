          Allegory is a game I've wanted to make for a little bit. Its an RPG, without the battles.
          As this project is a work in progress, consider the below a README, and TODO list, for now.
          For now, I'm building this in JavaScript, leveraging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyi4vfbKEeo&ab_channel=DrewConley">Drew Conley's Tutorial</a>
          as there are certain parts of <code>canvas</code>, that I don't quite know. Additionally,
          the aim is to use game develop patterns, rather than more web development patterns, though
          I know there will be some crossover, at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game is inspired by JRPGs like Final Fantasy Tactics (my favorite), and the story is loosely
          based on Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust. Rhyz, a great vampire, rules a region called Limberry.
          You, the hero, and the party you assemble, are tasked with clearing the countryside of Rhyz's
          minions, and defeating him.

          More will be put on this page, as the game develops.
